# Storage Manager

This library exposes the logic to query: HDFS, KUDU and OpenTSDB.
In particular it allows to:

1. get a dataset by a `logical_uri`
2. get the schema of a dataset by a `logical_uri`
3. query a dataset and filter `columns`
4. apply `where` conditions
5. apply `groupBy`

## How to use it
